=== CHAPTER 01 ===

[SCENE: CH01_S01 | POV: Sherry | Location: Retreat Center]

The woman who would destroy civilization as we knew it sat cross-legged in a basement meditation cell, tears streaming down her face beneath a sleek black virtual reality headset.

The hum of the device resonated through Sherry’s temples, sending waves of warmth throughout her body. Patterns of light bloomed behind her closed eyes, emerging not as mere visuals but as if they were born from deep within her. Bright flares pulsed, commanding her attention, while softer, more fleeting shapes lingered at the edges, like whispers caught on a breeze. Each light, each pulse, resonated with a strange familiarity, weaving through her mind like a forgotten song.

Her breathing slowed, syncing with the pulse that throbbed at the base of her skull. Memories floated past her awareness like leaves on a still stream: the crisp scent of winter mornings, her father’s aftershave, the comforting weight of her camera in Yosemite. But unlike before, when she might have clutched at these fragments, she watched them dissolve without resistance. The constant chatter of her mind softened, leaving a profound stillness that was almost tactile.

Tears flowed like morning dew, a natural condensation of something that had always been there, waiting to be recognized and released. The cushion beneath her legs pressed into her skin, a weave of textures that grounded her in this space. The cool air brushed against her damp cheeks, anchoring her as the boundaries between herself and the room shifted, becoming porous.

A shift occurred within her then, as if she had woken up from a sleep she couldn’t remember falling into. The distinct tone she knew indicated the completion of the protocol echoed through the room.

Muffled voices from outside the meditation cell filtered in, sharp and strained. Tim’s voice, so familiar, carried an urgency she hadn’t often heard. Moments later, he appeared in the doorway, his eyes wide and shadowed with worry. He stepped into the room, the tension radiating from him like heat.

“How do you feel?” he asked, crouching down, his voice low but edged with anticipation. His fingers played absently with the loop of meditation beads around his wrist.

Sherry let the question settle into the silence before responding. “I feel awake,” she replied, each word imbued with a truth that resonated in her chest.

Relief flashed across Tim’s face, softening his features for an instant. He glanced over his shoulder, where footsteps echoed in the corridor.

“Meeting in the hall,” he called to the figures waiting outside.

Sherry watched as Zach Goodman strode past, his brow furrowed, tension visible in the tightness of his jaw. Carly Rice followed, clutching her notepad so tightly her knuckles whitened. The energy of their anxiety buzzed at the edge of Sherry’s awareness, sharp and electric, like a storm building on the horizon.

They moved down the hall and around a corner, but she could still make out their voices through the low hum of the servers filling the next room, mingling with the sound of her breath. Her fingers brushed the rough fabric of the cushion, grounding her as the ripples of their departure settled. She sensed the gravity of their meeting, the way their hurried steps and clipped voices had disturbed the room’s stillness.

Time seemed to expand, punctuated only by the rhythmic thrum of the servers in the next room. Dust motes drifted through the thin beam of light filtering from the small, barred window, a reminder of the world beyond unchanged, yet irrevocably altered. Sherry closed her eyes and let her awareness deepen, the calm wrapping around her like a familiar blanket.

“We need guidelines for containment.” She could hear Zach, a distinct worry in his voice. “One success of this algorithm to enlightenment is remarkable. But two? Three? Someone’s going to notice.”

“We’re not stopping,” she heard Tim quickly cut in.

“He’s not saying stop.” Now it was Carly, bringing her familiar calming tone. “He’s saying we need to be smarter. More careful. The moment this gets out…”

“Fine,” Tim said. “Start on it and let me get back to Sherry.”

When Tim returned, the weight of the meeting was etched into the lines of his face. He moved with deliberate steps, settling across from her. His eyes, still searching, met hers with a mix of awe and fear.

“We’ve turned the wheel of dharma,” he said, voice trembling with reverence and doubt. “This changes everything.”

Sherry regarded him, the flicker of fear beneath his excitement even clearer to her now. A wave of compassion swelled in her chest. He was still seeking, grasping for the security of answers. But she no longer needed that certainty. There was only the awareness, vast and serene.

“I am struck by your extraordinary radiance and peaceful presence,” Tim said—practiced words she realized—a quote. The hint of a smile crept across his face, breaking through his tension.

The words touched her, but they passed through her awareness like a ripple on a pond. “It is no different, yet completely different,” she said after a moment. “I see the same objects, the same colors, even seem to have the same thoughts, like recognizing your quote.”

Tim’s expression shifted, a glimmer of understanding dawning.

Sherry’s gaze swept the room, taking in the familiar shapes that now seemed charged with new clarity. “Yet there is an immediacy, a vividness, a clarity… not in the things themselves, but in my perception of them.”

For a moment, Tim’s eyes reflected the enormity of what this meant, the millions of lives that could be touched and changed. The responsibility loomed, and she saw the tremor of doubt return.

“Everything changes, Tim,” she whispered, the words an echo of truth. “The goal is to awaken to that truth.”

He nodded, the tension in his posture easing as understanding settled over him. She was referring to the concept of impermanence. “The protocol will need looking after,” he said, almost as if to himself. “To continue, to develop, to share…”

[SCENE: CH01_S02 | POV: Sherry | Location: Retreat Center]

The hum of servers from the next room seemed to pulse with his racing thoughts. He pressed his thumb against his deceased brother’s meditation beads, the familiar grain of wood anchoring him as Zach’s footsteps approached again, sharp against the floor.

“She’s still stable?” Zach’s voice searched for something measurable. Sherry heard the edge of fear beneath the technical question.

“She’s awake,” Tim corrected, not turning to look at him.

Carly moved into the room, her administrative confidence faltering. “The first successful trial,” she said, clutching her notepad like a shield. “We need guidelines, protocols for…”

“Protocols?” Tim interjected, a sharp laugh that escaped him. “We’ve turned consciousness itself into code, and you want a policy manual?”

“The brain scans are clear,” Zach pressed on, his voice tight with nervous energy. He moved to Tim’s right, tablet in hand. “Neural plasticity off the charts, default mode network showing unprecedented…”

“Look at her,” Tim cut in. Sherry sensed Zach stiffen beside him. “Really look. Do you need a scan to tell you what’s happened? She is a completely enlightened being. A Buddha.”

Sherry sat unmoving, but her presence filled the room like light filling a dark space. Even the air seemed to breathe differently around her.

“We need to document everything,” Carly said, but her voice had lost its administrative edge. “The next participant…”

“Will be here tomorrow,” Tim finished. “And the next soon after. And the next…” The words trailed off, a weight settling over the room.

Zach’s sharp intake of breath carried all his terror of uncontrolled variables. “Tim, we can’t just…”

“Can’t just what?” Tim turned to face him. “Can’t just let people wake up? Can’t just show them what’s real?” His voice cracked on the last word. “Tell me, how many more Michaels do we need before it’s worth the risk?”

Sherry’s voice, when it came, cut through the tension like a knife through fog. “The dharma will find its way.” Six simple words, but they carried the weight of certainty.

Zach and Carly exchanged glances. Sherry experienced the current of their anxiety against her stillness. The protocol was working. That was the miracle and the terror of it for them. Everything they’d theorized, everything they’d coded and tested and feared, was sitting before them in human form, and it was her.

“The retreat center can’t handle this,” Zach muttered, his hand running through his hair. “One success we could contain, but if we run more trials…”

“Trials?” the edge was apparent in Tim’s voice. “Is that what we’re calling it now? Clinical trials for the end of suffering?” His brother’s beads clicked softly between his fingers, a sound that Sherry sensed used to bring comfort but was now feeling like a countdown.

“Two more candidates are ready,” Carly said.

“My brother Michael would have been first in line,” Tim said softly, the words seeming to escape before he could catch them. “He would have…” But he couldn’t finish.

“He would have understood,” Zach filled the silence, his voice gentler than Sherry had ever heard it. “The risks, the potential consequences, he would have said they were worth it.”

“Would he? Or am I just telling myself that to justify what we’re about to do?” Tim looked up, meeting their eyes one by one. “Because let’s be clear, we’re not just running more ‘trials.’ We’re about to break open the world.”

“The quantum processors are stable,” Zach said, falling back on technical certainty. “The neural interface is cleaner than anything we’ve seen. The AI learning curves…”

“Where in the code,” Tim cut in, his voice rising, “did we account for this?” He gestured toward Sherry. “Is there a function for dissolving everything a person thinks they are?”

Sherry contemplated this, there was a wider gulf than Tim knew between the thoughts of who one was and the dissolution of that self.

Tim’s brother’s beads clicked softly as he stood. “I need to check on the figures, then help Zach with the final calibrations for tomorrow.”

Carly responded quietly as she and Zach walked out.

[SCENE: CH01_S03 | POV: Sherry | Location: Retreat Center]

“They’re terrified,” Tim said, settling back onto the cushion across from her. “Not of getting caught. Not of the technical risks. They’re terrified of exactly what they say they want.”

“Like you. You’re holding so tight,” Sherry continued. Not a criticism, not a suggestion to let go. Just a clear seeing aimed to strip away all his defenses.

“Someone has to,” Tim said, but even as the words left his mouth, she recognized their emptiness. “Someone has to…” He trailed off. “My brother died looking for this. He died trying to find what you’re sitting in right now.” His voice cracked. “He died still searching.”

“And now you’re afraid,” Sherry said, her words like light through fog, “that if you really look, if you really see what we’ve built, you’ll have to face that it was always this simple. That he didn’t have to die searching.”

“How do I…” he started, his voice barely a whisper. “How do I keep running this program, keep watching it work, keep sending people through that door, knowing…” The rest of the sentence dissolved into a sob he apparently couldn’t contain.

“Knowing I could have saved him,” Tim finally managed, the words scraping from his throat raw. “Knowing if I’d just figured it out sooner, coded faster, seen clearer…” His hands clutched Michael’s beads so tight the pattern pressed into his palm. “Knowing he died right here in this building, searching for what we’ve turned into ones and zeros.”

“You’re still searching,” Sherry said.

“I don’t know how to do this,” Tim said, in what Sherry knew was a confession.

“The dharma will find its way,” Sherry repeated, her voice steady, as certain as the pull of gravity or a heartbeat.

“He tried to tell me,” Tim whispered, his voice rough. “At the end, when the drugs weren’t working anymore, when meditation wasn’t enough… He said, ‘Timmy, it’s right here. It’s always been right here.’”

“We built this whole machine,” Tim said, gesturing at the headset, “to show people what they already are. Quantum mechanics, neural interfaces, AI, it all sounds, but it’s just a mirror.”

“How many lines of code?” Tim asked, his voice cracking. “How many thousands of lines just to… to…” His hand trembled over the headset. “Just to make it impossible to look away anymore? To force people to see what’s been staring them in the face their whole lives.”

Sherry remained motionless, just being in this moment with her friend. She noticed a new faculty within her. She made her presence expand, holding space for this terrible understanding.

“We turned consciousness into a code,” Tim continued, “using algorithms to mirror what meditation and sacred rituals have done for ages. AI now guides people to the doorway my brother tried so hard to reach.”

“Is this what everyone’s going to see?” he asked, his voice barely audible. “When they put on the headset? When the quantum processors spin up and the AI guides them through? Are they all going to see what a cosmic joke this is? That we built the most advanced technology in human history just to…”

Sherry saw into Tim then, with that faltering question, as she saw into every corner of the meditation cell, every shadow of every light thrown about the space, every texture of every piece of clothing she wore. She knew he didn’t want an answer.

“Let’s meditate awhile,” she said, adjusting her posture. The invitation needed no further explanation. Tim’s breath caught before he exhaled, settling into the stillness with her as the light shifted, touching the room with a quiet, awakened presence.

=== CHAPTER 02 ===

[SCENE: CH02_S01 | POV: Bud | Location: Hull's Bar]

Freeman “Bud” Turner, Director of Government Relations and Community Engagement. The new title resonated in his mind. He handed out another card. Around him, friends and colleagues gathered at the end of the bar, exchanging laughter and clinking glasses.

Hull’s bar teemed with energy, unusually busy for a Sunday. It was the type of place where professionals brought clients for dinner or stopped by for drinks after work, hoping to run into familiar faces in government, finance and industry. For Bud, Hull’s wasn’t just a favorite spot; it was where business truly got done. It made sense that he was here, celebrating his promotion.

Bud worked for one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence companies. With the promotion, he now oversaw how it engaged with local communities and governments, from neighborhood associations to Congress.

Years of navigating bureaucracies and administrations had equipped him well. With a master’s in public affairs and a law degree under his belt, he knew his sharp mind and quick wit made him stand out. Most people seemed to genuinely like him. That last trait was especially useful. Bud’s natural charisma and genuine interest in others made him persuasive in a way that seemed effortless.

“Congratulations, Director of Government Relations,” Frank O’Hearn said, clinking his glass against Bud’s with a knowing smile.

Bud’s eyes narrowed. When a Board Chairman from a competing company sought him out at Hull’s, it was rarely a coincidence.

“Thanks, Frank,” Bud said, studying the older man’s expression as he sipped his drink.

Frank’s smile hardened at the edges. “Though I’m afraid your first challenge just landed on your desk.”

Bud tilted his head, feeling a prickle of apprehension. Years in tech regulation had taught him to listen when someone like Frank spoke.

“The World Health Organization is pushing for neural interface regulations,” Frank continued. “Some bureaucrats in Geneva convinced half the city that consciousness-altering technology needs oversight before it even exists.” He let out a dry laugh. “I trust you’ll help them see how… premature that would be, for the sake of both our companies?”

Bud’s smile was automatic, though unease coiled inside him. “Of course,” he replied, filing the information away as Frank’s intensity lingered in the air. The industry’s worst fears often came before major leaps in innovation. “Why the urgency for regulation?” he added, unable to ignore the feeling that he was missing a piece of the puzzle.

Frank’s hand clapped down on Bud’s shoulder, firm but brief. “Let’s just say I’ve seen some interesting patent applications lately. We can’t let bureaucrats strangle innovation in its cradle.” With that, Frank melted back into the crowd.

Bud exhaled slowly, his mind already tracing the threads of influence he’d need to pull to kill regulations like these. But even as he mapped out phone calls and strategy, an itch of doubt lingered. Why was Frank so invested? Although the entire industry could be effected by the regulations, the man rarely concerned himself with routine regulation battles.

Cheryl appeared at his side, glass raised. “To you,” she said, eyes twinkling.

Bud’s chest warmed at her presence, and he slipped an arm around her waist. “And to my wife,” he added, raising his own glass, “who helped me reach where I am today and makes every success worth it.”

The room hummed with laughter and cheer as Bud kissed Cheryl’s temple. Her smile transported him to a place where the noise and the pressures melted away, leaving only the two of them in a perfect, unbroken moment. He whispered, “I love you,” before they parted to continue mingling, the night unfolding in its usual whirl of conversation and clinks of glass.

[SCENE: CH02_S02 | POV: Bud | Location: Hull's Bar]

“Hey, what’s new?” Joe, a programmer from O’Hearn’s company, asked, sidling up with an easy grin. Bud had come to appreciate Joe’s sharp mind and dry humor during joint projects funding tech classes at state universities.

Bud smirked, swirling his drink. “Your chairman just all but assigned me a task like I report to him.”

Joe’s eyebrows shot up. “Frank? Is it the neural interface stuff?”

Bud nodded, the tension from earlier returning. “Yeah, and it feels bigger than my new job title.”

Joe leaned in, voice dropping. “Wouldn’t be surprised. One of our execs was asking about regulations and platform bans, domestic stuff, if you catch my drift.”

The unease in Bud’s gut deepened. “Let’s grab coffee tomorrow. We should talk more.”

Joe nodded, raising his glass in agreement. “Congratulations, Bud. They’re lucky to have you.”

“They sure are,” Bud said with a smile, setting down his empty glass and signaling the bartender. “Seltzer, please.”

Eric, the regular bartender, filled the glass and leaned in, a teasing glint in his eye.

[SCENE: CH02_S03 | POV: Bud | Location: Walk Home]

As Bud walked home that night, the excitement of the evening softened into quiet contemplation. The cool air carried the scent of rain, and his mind drifted to Cheryl as she walked beside him. She’d been different lately, more centered since she started those mindfulness classes. He’d been skeptical when her doctor suggested meditation for stress, but the change was undeniable.

Frank’s cryptic comments, together with Joe’s hints about regulations, stirred something in Bud. Pushing back against regulations was second nature to him. “The future’s coming whether we’re ready or not,” he often told legislators. But lately, he questioned his reflexive stance on regulation.

Cheryl had pointed it out last week. “Not everything needs disrupting,” she’d said, leaning over the kitchen counter after one of his tirades. “Sometimes slow and steady wins the race.”

He’d laughed it off, but her words gnawed at him now. It could be that Joe’s comments bothered him. They poked at the comfort he found in certainty.

Bud shook his head, pushing away the doubt. He had a job to do, interests to protect. But tonight’s conversation had left a sliver of unease that he couldn’t shake.

[SCENE: CH02_S04 | POV: Bud | Location: Coffee Shop]

The next morning, Bud’s unease grew as he approached the coffee shop where he’d agreed to meet Joe. The early chill bit at his neck, but he ignored it, quickening his step. His mind replayed the snippets of conversation from the night before, looking for what was gnawing at him.

Spotting Joe at their usual table, the farthest in the corner, Bud felt a flicker of relief. Joe raised two cups, signaling he’d already ordered for them.

“Joe,” Bud called, stepping over the small fence to avoid walking through the crowded shop. “You’ve got my attention.”

Joe placed Bud’s coffee in front of him, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips. “I figured.”

Bud took a sip, savoring the rich, nutty flavor. The warmth slid to his core, a brief reprieve from the buzzing questions in his head. “So, what’s this all about?” he asked, keeping his tone light.

Joe’s grin was fleeting. “One of our mid-level execs was poking around, asking if any past projects were shelved because of platform bans.”

Bud’s brow furrowed. “Sounded official?”

Joe shook his head. “If it were, we’d hear from HR or Legal first. This felt… different.”

“Were there any?” Bud asked, leaning in.

“I don’t know,” Joe admitted, finishing his coffee. “But the way he asked, like he knew something. And then there’s the chatter about neural interfacing.”

“Chatter?” Bud’s pulse quickened.

Joe’s eyes darkened, a rare seriousness replacing his usual levity. “This executive is an AI expert, Bud. If he’s concerned, we should be too. Could the WHO really ban a program outright?”

Bud’s mouth set in a firm line. “They could try. We’d fight it, of course.” He gave a tight smile, but his mind raced. “This suit got a name?”

Joe hesitated before leaning in. “Zach Goodman.”

[SCENE: CH02_S05 | POV: Bud | Location: Bud's House]

That night, Bud leaned back into the patio chair and looked out at the stars over his backyard. The cool air carried the scent of freshly cut grass, mingled with the rich aroma of his cigar. The fall evening was crisp, perfect. He let the silence settle over him, a brief respite from the buzzing questions in his mind. Cheryl sat nearby, curled up with her glass of wine. She glanced at him, her eyes softening as they met his.

“Penny for your thoughts?” she asked, her voice breaking the quiet.

Bud chuckled, turning to face her. “They don’t come that cheap,” he teased, with a laugh that sounded less heavy than he anticipated.

“Inflation,” she joked, shifting to face him more fully, the glass resting against her lips before she took a small sip.

Bud’s smile lingered as he looked at her, but the weight of the day pressed back into his chest. “I was just thinking about how lucky I am, this house, this life, you.”

Cheryl’s eyes narrowed playfully,. “You work hard for all this,” she said, tilting her head. “But you’re still thinking about something else.”

Bud exhaled, conceding with a nod. “I was wondering, what if the legislature tried to ban the new AI virtual reality platform?”

Her brow furrowed as she set her glass down. “You’d be able to stop them, wouldn’t you?”

A flicker of doubt crossed his mind, but he pushed it aside. “Of course. But what if I couldn’t? What if it went further, making it illegal to even own a headset?”

Cheryl’s lips parted as she considered the question. “They could stop imports, halt sales. But why would they?” She watched him closely, curiosity mixed with concern.

“I don’t know,” Bud said. “It seems far-fetched, but with neural interfaces, anything feels possible.”

She leaned closer, her eyes steady and confident. “If anyone could stop the government from doing something that drastic, it’s you,” she said, her voice unwavering.

A soft smile pulled at his lips as he met her gaze. “Yeah,” he murmured, letting the tension ease slightly. He looked back out at the stars, the endless sky seeming to stretch out with possibilities he couldn’t quite grasp. He pushed the thoughts aside, leaning over to kiss her, the warmth of her touch grounding him. “I guess you’re right.”

“Of course I am,” Cheryl said, a playful smile lighting her face. “I’m your wife. Now, how about some neural interfacing of our own, Mr. Director?”

=== CHAPTER 03 ===

[SCENE: CH03_S01 | POV: Tim | Location: Retreat Center]

After lunch, Tim swung by the retreat center and found Zach bent over his desk, surrounded by scattered papers and schematics. Tim leaned against the edge of the desk, arms crossed, eyes scanning the disarray. Tension twisted in his chest; Zach looked worn out, his face marked by lines of fatigue. The silence between them was taut, their earlier conversation about the future of the protocol having stalled. Neither wanted to confront the fears simmering unspoken.

“We’re close,” Tim said quietly, his voice carrying the weight of exhaustion that clung to him like a shadow. His gaze shifted to the meditation mala beads on the desk, Michael’s beads. They seemed to pulse with unspoken memories. “But every time I think about what comes next… I just can’t shake this feeling.” His voice wavered, and he glanced at Zach before his eyes settled on the beads again. “I keep thinking about Michael.”

Zach’s head snapped up, “Tim…”

Tim swallowed hard, the familiar pressure of grief threatening to surface. “He came here at the end, you know, before the overdose. He was trying so hard to find peace. I thought I could help him. I thought meditation and everything I’d learned would be enough to pull him back from that darkness.” His voice cracked, and he blinked against the sting in his eyes. “But it wasn’t. I wasn’t enough.”

The air between them shifted, the pain palpable. Zach’s expression softened, guilt gnawing at Tim’s gut as he caught the empathy in Zach’s eyes. “You can’t blame yourself for that,” Zach said, his voice low and steady. “You did everything you could.”

Tim’s throat tightened, and he shook his head. Vision clouded with memories and what-ifs. “But what if the protocol had been there then? What if I’d found the key sooner? He could have been saved. This headset could have burned through all that karma weighing him down. He’d still be here.” The ache in his chest surged, raw and unforgiving.

Zach leaned forward, and Tim caught the way his friend’s shoulders tensed, as if holding back his own memories. “I get it,” Zach said, a tremor breaking through the calm in his voice. “I’ve lost people too. Friends. Colleagues. Some to their own battles, others to the obsession with work. This thing we’re creating, it’s powerful. But I don’t want it to cost us more lives. I don’t want to lose anyone else to it.”

The room seemed smaller, the silence between them became heavier. Tim looked down, his voice barely a whisper. “I don’t want to lose anyone either.”

For the first time, the silence seemed to bridge the distance between them, shared regrets weaving through the unspoken pain. The enormity of what they had accomplished loomed in Tim’s mind, no longer just about the groundbreaking technology but the people they had cherished and lost, and the ones they still had a chance to save.

[SCENE: CH03_S02 | POV: Tim | Location: Tim's Apartment]

That night, Tim opened his apartment door to welcome Finn. He glanced at the clock; it was just past seven. The living room, filled with stacks of books and research papers, felt smaller than usual with the extra company. Finn had been at his side since the first prototype, so he knew what to expect. But tonight, Jessica, a former co-worker of Tim’s who moved up from that coffee shop to start policy work for the local state senator, was going to join them.

Tim stood by the makeshift whiteboard leaning against the wall, his fingers brushing the dry-erase marker as he took a breath. “We went with the assumption that the ideas behind the Buddhist scriptures on enlightenment were scientific, not just religious. Luckily, centuries of work had been done secularizing those texts to strip away the layers of cultural and religious interpretations. Take the term ‘enlightenment,’ for example.”

“Nirvana,” Jessica blurted, shifting restlessly.

“Exactly,” Tim said, a hint of a smile forming. “Can I give you a quick lecture, to help explain? There are countless interpretations of what that term means, shaped by local beliefs and customs from the time of the Buddha and those who followed. But scientifically, in modern language, what does it really mean?” He paused, letting the question hang in the air. “We needed to define what we were asking our program to help us achieve, or so we thought. The truth was, none of us knew from firsthand experience what that state of mind looked like. There was no definitive brain scan that could guide us, no map to enlightenment. We were navigating blind.”

Jessica tilted her head, a spark of intrigue lighting her expression. “So, what did you do?” she asked, her voice soft but eager.

Tim’s mouth tightened with a blend of pride and uncertainty, recalling those early days. “We approached the problem differently. Instead of trying to define enlightenment, we focused on the steps to get there. Ancient Buddhist texts provide detailed meditation instructions that supposedly lead to enlightenment. So we programmed those instructions into our AI system. The AI guides users through these meditation practices in virtual reality. Our hope was simple: if someone completes all the prescribed steps in VR, they’d achieve what the texts promised—enlightenment—even though we couldn’t scientifically define what enlightenment actually is.”

The room fell silent as Tim’s words settled over them. He glanced at Jessica, noting the way her fingers absently traced the seam of the couch, her mind clearly racing with thoughts. She sat back; eyes fixed on the whiteboard as if searching for the missing pieces.

“Ah,” Jessica said, the word drawn-out as if she understood, though Tim could tell from the confused furrow in her brow that she didn’t. Finn looked on knowingly, having worked through these problems with Tim and the others in the Protocol’s development.

Tim leaned back slightly, drawing a deep breath to steady himself before explaining further. “Let’s put it this way,” he said. Throughout your life, you build up mental patterns that shape how you see everything. The VR program unravels these patterns one by one, showing you that what you thought was real, your thoughts, feelings, and even what your senses tell you, are actually just illusions.

He paused, catching Jessica’s eyes, which were now wide with interest. “It’s one thing to read or be told that these things are empty of independent existence, to think you understand it in theory. But it’s another to truly experience and internalize it at the most fundamental level.”

Jessica leaned forward, a question on her lips. “How exactly does this protocol work?”

Tim’s lips curled into a subtle smile as he straightened his posture, chest expanding slightly. His fingers tapped a quick, eager rhythm against his thigh while his eyes remained fixed on the door, waiting. He nodded slightly. “Great question. The AI acts as a guide that adapts to each user’s unique brain activity. It’s like having a personal meditation coach that learns from your patterns and adjusts its methods as you progress. It fine-tunes its guidance as you move deeper into awareness, similar to how a meditation teacher might customize their lessons based on a student’s development.”

Jessica’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, a crease forming on her brow. “You mean it actually changes the brain’s structure and function?”

Tim met her gaze and nodded. “Precisely. The protocol doesn’t ‘zap’ the brain. It helps guide users through mental patterns, like a meditation teacher would.” He paused for a moment, searching for the right metaphor and settling on one that had resonated with others before. “Think of it as a GPS for the mind. It maps out your mental roads and helps you navigate through the patterns you’ve been conditioned to follow, guiding you to your destination. It doesn’t change your mind; it shows you how to find the way on your own terms.”

Tim watched as Jessica’s fingers tapped lightly against her knee, her mind clearly processing what he had said. The quiet hum of thought in the room was nearly tangible, and he allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. This was the beginning of understanding.

“So, it’s like… an algorithm to enlightenment?” she asked, her voice tinged with a mix of curiosity and skepticism.

Tim nodded, liking the ring to her statement. “Exactly. It guides users step-by-step, like a teacher, only faster. The practical benefit is that it helps people break free from destructive thought patterns that cause real suffering. Users report reduced anxiety, clearer decision-making, and more meaningful relationships within weeks, not the years or decades traditional practices might take.”

Her brow furrowed again, doubt crossing her face. “Wait. Aren’t you tied to the results of your bad karma? The program lets you escape the consequences of your actions?”

Tim met her eyes, his expression firm. “No, that would be impossible,” he said, his voice steady, carrying the weight of countless conversations like this one. “Externally, your actions have already set into motion the energy needed to create their consequences. This isn’t about erasing what’s been done. What the protocol does is address the problem at its root. Take, for instance, the damage you might have done to yourself through unhealthy habits. You’ll still face the physical repercussions, but your future reactions to that pain will be skillful, preventing further karma from being created. A smoker’s lungs would not be miraculously cured, but the craving to smoke would be rooted out. It all happens at the deepest level of awareness.”

He noticed Jessica’s eyes widen slightly, gears of comprehension turning. “Fascinating. So, by stripping away this illusion of a separate self, the protocol allows people to directly experience reality in a new way?” she asked curiously.

“Exactly,” Tim nodded, the resonance of her understanding reaching him. “The goal is to provide an unfiltered, firsthand grasp of the impermanence and interdependence of your thoughts, emotions and senses. It’s a profound shift in how you perceive everything.”

A pause settled over the room, heavy with contemplation. Tim’s gaze drifted to Finn, who leaned forward, his eyes lit with a familiarity. Finn cleared his throat and spoke up, his voice carrying a practiced calm. “When I practiced insight meditation, I would scan my body for sensations, training myself little by little to stop identifying with them. Like when my knee ached from sitting too long. My brain would immediately label that pain as mine, sparking aversion and breaking my concentration, forcing me to shift and disrupt my focus. But eventually, I learned to just be aware of the pain, detached from it. It wasn’t mine; it wasn’t inherently good or bad. It simply existed. That allowed me to continue moving my awareness elsewhere, down to my toes or up to my head, without losing my composure.”

Tim listened, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. Finn’s explanation captured what he had spent so long trying to convey, and for a moment, the room felt unified in shared understanding.

“The next realization was that the pain itself had no inherent existence,” Finn continued, his words tumbled out faster as he spoke, eyes widening. He leaned forward, the pitch of his voice climbed higher on key phrases, and he barely paused for breath between sentences. Tim’s eyes flicked to Finn, appreciating how he brought energy into the room. “Imagine that. It would arise and disappear depending on conditions that were set long before I even sat down to meditate.”

Tim nodded, the connection between their thoughts seamless. “Exactly. So, if you’d hurt your leg as a child, the protocol wouldn’t heal the old wound, but it would help you fundamentally change your understanding and reaction to similar pain in the future” Tim said, his tone softening with emphasis. “Enlightenment isn’t about becoming immune to pain or joy but being truly aware of them and recognizing their true nature.”

Finn leaned in, eyes glinting. “Yes, and don’t forget, joy can be just as distracting as pain. It’s just as empty, just as fleeting.”

Tim glanced at Jessica, seeing the flicker of understanding on her face. He took a breath and continued, “Which brings us to a challenge the Buddha himself pointed out in his time. It’s a challenge just as relevant now, if not more so. This truth is subtle, deep, and difficult to fully grasp, while his generation, and ours, revels in sensory pleasures.”

Finn raised an eyebrow. “And that was before television, commercials, the internet and virtual reality.”

Tim allowed a small chuckle to escape. Jessica’s expression grew contemplative, and she finally spoke, “We have no chance of internalizing this without the protocol.”

Tim’s smile faded, replaced by a thoughtful look. “Probably not,” he admitted, a hint of weariness seeping into his voice. “Although, throughout the centuries, who knows how many reached enlightenment and, out of sheer frustration, chose not to teach what they discovered.” He paused, looking from face-to-face, sensing the shared curiosity. “But now, with the science and technology humanity has built over millennia in our quest for worldly pleasures, each of us has a chance, if we’re willing, to awaken. To live the remainder of our lives free from suffering.”

The silence that followed was almost reverent, Jessica absorbing Tim’s words in her own way. The weight of possibility hung in the room, and for a moment, Tim perceived the quiet hum of hope, a small, persistent note that resonated through them all.

[SCENE: CH03_S03 | POV: Tim | Location: Tim's Apartment]

Later that evening, after Finn and John had left, Tim sat in a plastic chair on the fire escape, the metal cool against his legs. The city hummed softly beneath them, and Jessica leaned over the railing, exhaling a deep sigh into the crisp night air. Tim glanced up at the moon, luminous and watchful, though the streetlights washed out the stars.

“I don’t know that I’m ready for enlightenment,” Jessica said suddenly, turning to meet Tim’s eyes. The streetlamp cast sharp shadows across her face, making her expression seem more vulnerable. “But I’m surprised you haven’t already gone through the protocol.”

Tim shifted, the chair creaking beneath him. “I’m not ready either,” he admitted, the words heavy on his tongue. “Probably for different reasons, though.”

A smirk broke across Jessica’s face. “I still fancy myself a woman with much trouble to get up to.”

Tim let out a short laugh, warmth breaking through the seriousness. “One of the many things I like about you, Jessica.” He stood, stretching his arms and nodding toward the window. “Come on. I want to show you something.”

They stepped back into the dimly lit apartment, the air warmer and carrying the scent of the books that lined the shelves. Tim picked up a worn book from the coffee table, its spine cracked from years of use and opened to a page. The image seemed to pulse with vibrant colors, a six-armed figure surrounded by flames, dark blue skin, fierce eyes, crowned with skulls, and standing over a crushed figure. Weapons gleamed from each hand, and a necklace of severed heads draped across its chest.

Jessica leaned in, eyes wide. “It’s hideous,” she said, a grin breaking through. “I love it.”

“A dharmapala,” Tim said, running a finger along the edge of the page. “A guardian of the dharma. Fierce, terrifying, but ultimately a protector of the path to enlightenment.” He closed the book gently, looking up at Jessica. “These wrathful deities aren’t evil—they represent the forceful compassion needed to protect wisdom from being corrupted. That’s why I’m not ready for the protocol yet. Do you remember what a bodhisattva is?”

Jessica’s brow furrowed, processing what Tim had just explained about the AI-powered VR system. “A being who forsakes their own enlightenment until everyone else has attained it.”

“Exactly.” Tim nodded, the light catching the silver at his temples. “In Buddhist tradition, a bodhisattva reaches the threshold of complete liberation—what we call Buddhahood—but makes a sacred vow to remain in the cycle of suffering until all sentient beings are free. They could cross over into perfect awakening, but choose to stay behind as guides instead.”

“The path…” Jessica said with newfound understanding. “You’re talking about the protocol, aren’t you? You think it needs protection?”

“It will,” Tim said, tapping the closed cover of the book, the weight of conviction pressing into his chest. “What we’ve created isn’t just technology—it’s a shortcut through millennia of spiritual practice. The protocol can burn through lifetimes of accumulated karma in hours, leaving a person fully awakened. But that kind of power—instant Buddhahood without the gradual tempering of the spiritual path—it could be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Or even in well-meaning but unprepared minds.”

Jessica’s eyes widened. “So you’re choosing to be the guardian rather than using it yourself.”

“Someone has to stand at the threshold,” Tim said, his gaze drifting back to the fierce deity on the book’s cover. “Someone who understands both the technology we’ve built and the ancient wisdom it’s based on. And whoever takes on that task will have to be fierce and willing to make difficult decisions about who’s ready and who isn’t. Like the dharmapala.”

Jessica stood up, stretching, and letting out a soft chuckle. “Well, I’m not wearing a necklace of skulls, it’d clash with my blazer,” she joked, a glimmer of lightness returned to her tone. “Give a lady a ride home?”

Tim smiled, the tension in his chest easing just a bit as he grabbed his keys from the table. “Let’s go.”

=== CHAPTER 04 ===

[SCENE: CH04_S01 | POV: Georgia | Location: Jeta's Grove]

That morning, walking the grounds alone, Georgia Sato reached the small pond where her grandfather used to fish. The moon’s reflection wavered on the dark water, catching her eye as she paused. Memories of sitting here as a child, watching him cast his line with serene patience, surfaced unbidden. He never seemed to care whether he caught anything.

“The fish are just an excuse,” he told her once. “The real purpose is to sit quietly and watch your mind.”

She had been too young to understand then. Her father had never understood either, too consumed with building the business empire she now helmed. The estate accounting had valued them at nothing, but to her, they were priceless—a piece of wisdom passed down.

Years of corporate acquisitions, billion-dollar deals, and strategic battles in boardrooms had honed her into a formidable leader. The triumphs were satisfying, but true peace had remained elusive. The ambition that fueled her left no space for contentment. The calm moments with her grandfather and in her meditation practice were elusive now.

Her initial meditation practice had been a simple tool for stress management, fifteen minutes squeezed in after her morning workout, before the first meeting of the day. But recently, those moments had taken on a different tone. The same sharp mind that parsed corporate balance sheets now turned inward, dissecting the very foundation she’d built her life upon. She wondered how long she could keep walking both paths. It was becoming more apparent she would have to either choose the path of enlightenment or the path of worldly pleasures.

“Proper temple offerings can generate great merit,” her grandfather’s voice echoed in her mind. “But true merit comes from helping others find the path.”

She had always assumed he spoke of his donations to the Pure Land temples. Those gestures she’d admired but never deeply questioned. Now, as she watched the moon’s reflection fracture on the water’s surface, she wondered if his words had held another meaning, one she may have been blind to.

Georgia returned the beads to her pocket, their weight grounding her as she stood. The tailored lines of her designer suit seemed almost absurd against the simplicity of the scene. In the corporate world, she was known as a force, brilliant, uncompromising, always in control. Yet none of them knew of the doubts that gnawed at her, the growing suspicion that her achievements were just another layer of suffering. The question that had begun to haunt her surfaced again: what if all her power and resources could be repurposed for something beyond wealth?

Her gaze drifted back to the main house, where Ed and the others stood on the porch, their laughter reaching her faintly in the breeze. That familiar tangle of envy and yearning twisted in her chest. They had found the answer her grandfather had hinted at, the one she had been skirting all her life. The question remained—was she ready to search for it herself?

“I heard you made your money the old-fashioned way, Georgia,” Tim said, his grin warm as she stepped onto the porch.

Georgia took in the scene, a familiar space filled with trusted faces, and met his eyes, her own smile controlled. The breeze tugged gently at her long, straight black hair, which she wore down her back. Her button nose crinkled slightly as she responded, and her hazel eyes, sharp with experience, met his.

“Yes, yes, I inherited it,” she replied, her tone light but layered. “But my real work has been in managing it, and at that, I have excelled.” Her gaze drifted over the others, seven in total, seated comfortably as they looked out at the lush field that rolled into the forest’s edge. This land had belonged to her grandfather, who had spent his final years tending to it, a simple life reminiscent of his youth in Japan.

He had named it Jeta’s Grove, explaining to her more than once the story of the businessman who had gifted land and a monastery to the Buddha and his followers. The name had always resonated with her. Unlike her grandfather, who had devotedly funded Pure Land temples across San Francisco and beyond, her father had shed much of that religious commitment when they left California during her childhood.

Georgia leaned back, watching the others as they relaxed on the porch.

Funding the protocol had been a calculated risk, one she took without expecting results. Yet the changes she saw in those who had undergone it, especially Ed, who she’d known for years, had shaken her. The man who now sat before them seemed both familiar and profoundly transformed.

“We have a while before lunch will be ready,” she said, pushing aside the tangle of thoughts and settling into one of the rocking chairs. She glanced at Ed, her tone light but inviting. “Would you share some thoughts in the meantime?”

Ed’s smile was subtle as he nodded, shifting his chair slightly to better face the group. He didn’t stand; there was no need. His presence commanded attention effortlessly. Georgia noted the small audience, Tim, Sarah and a few others from the retreat center, plus two workers who had joined them for a brief respite before the meal. The morning sunlight bathed them all in a warm glow, casting soft shadows that danced across the porch.

“Of course, Georgia, of course,” Ed began, his gaze moving gently across each face. To Georgia, he was the same man she’d always known, yet utterly changed. The furrows that once marked his face with worry had smoothed, and the restless energy she remembered was gone. Instead, he radiated a calm so deep, it was almost tangible. Georgia felt an ache in her chest, she wanted that peace, needed it in a way she could scarcely admit.

“I am humbled by Georgia’s offer of residence here at her Jeta’s Grove and grateful to be in the position in my life to accept,” Ed said, his voice resonant and sure. The air seemed to still as he continued. “Many ask me what it is like to be enlightened, and the truth is they…” he paused, his gaze sweeping down the row of listeners, “you… already know.”

Georgia’s breath caught for a moment. Her grandfather’s teachings surfaced in her mind, the Zen proverbs she’d once listened to with the impatience of youth. Ed’s words sounded like an echo of those lessons, but now they resonated differently.

“It really is the breeze on the skin. The earth under our feet,” Ed said, punctuating his point with a couple of light kicks to the porch boards. “It means being fully aware of everything around you without judging it as good or bad. Before, I was a prisoner of my own reactions. Each reaction was based on previous reactions, creating a chain going back so far that I had no hope of breaking free from it. Yet, with a little help,” he added, a playful smile breaking through as he winked, “I was able to break each link in that chain. I could finally see and understand the root causes behind all my unhealthy patterns of thinking and behavior.”

Georgia’s pulse quickened. The simplicity of his words hinted at a deeper transformation. She stilled, wondering what that peace would feel like.

“It was as if I was stuck in the waking moment,” Ed continued, his voice weaving through the stillness, “where one cannot quite discern what is real and what is a remnant of the dream. In shaking the head and rubbing the face, the dream flees, and the light from the bedroom window strikes the eyes and warms the skin, convincing one that yes, now they are fully awake. That is how it is now.”

The metaphor stirred something within Georgia, a yearning for clarity she had never acknowledged. He spoke with calm certainty that resonated deep in her chest, pulling at the questions she kept buried beneath boardroom strategies and asset portfolios.

“After my retirement, with that emptiness of the hours, the emptiness of my house after the loss of my dear wife, I yearned to awaken from that sterile suffering,” Ed said, his gaze meeting hers for a moment. Georgia recognized the longing in his eyes. “Yet I did not know how. I meditated, I bowed, I prayed to the great Amitabha Buddha to deliver me to the Pure Land. I moved to this hermitage. There was utility in this, of course. It helped with my blood pressure. It reminded me to do better, to be kinder, to keep striving. Yet the fuel which kept the fire of my passions fed remained.”

Georgia leaned forward slightly, the porch creaking beneath her as she listened. The restlessness, the striving without ever reaching satisfaction, mirrored the engine that had driven her for so long. She thought of the merger she’d orchestrated last quarter—how the thrill of closing the $4 billion deal had lasted barely a week before her mind was already hunting for the next acquisition. Or the beachfront property in Malibu she’d purchased after three years of negotiations, only to visit twice before the emptiness crept back in. No matter how many companies she added to her portfolio or how many zeros appeared in her net worth, that gnawing sense of “not enough” always returned, pushing her toward the next challenge, the next conquest.

“What kept that fire burning?” Ed’s voice softened. “The fuel was my endless wanting of pleasant experiences, my pushing away of unpleasant ones, and all my judgments about both. As I learned to step back from these reactions, one by one, I could simply be aware without constantly evaluating everything. A deep sense of balance emerged, allowing me to be fully present without being pulled toward pleasure or pushed away from pain. When I stopped adding fuel, the distracting fire naturally went out. That’s when I could truly see the world as it is - how everything connects and flows into everything else without separation. And then I realized my own awareness works the same way. Through directly experiencing this, not just thinking about it, I could see that nothing has a fixed, permanent nature - including myself. The fuel that I thought was necessary was never really there. I’m exactly where I always was, just fully awake to it now.”

Georgia’s mind buzzed with unasked questions as the lunch bell rang, cutting through the spell Ed’s words had cast. The group exchanged bows, murmuring thanks as they rose. Georgia offered Ed a quiet, sincere nod before turning to lead everyone inside.

One of the attendees quickened his pace to catch up with her and chuckled lightly. “Do you think this protocol would alleviate the silent suffering of my mandatory staff meeting tomorrow morning?”

It was a jest, casual and harmless, but it struck a nerve in Georgia. She forced a smile, though her thoughts raced. The young man reminded her of her assistant, the one who had helped install her AI hub and the virtual reality boardroom in her home office. Would her own board meetings feel trivial if she went through the protocol? Would she even care to hold board meetings at all?

The thought expanded, unwelcome and heavy. If she no longer needed to chase success, would her assistant, her secretary or anyone else still have jobs if she suddenly stopped needing anything? The implications coiled inside her, making her fingers tighten around the porch railing until her knuckles whitened. She stood abruptly, her heart racing as scenarios flashed through her mind like warning signals. Just because she stopped needing things didn’t mean others wouldn’t still need to feed their families.

She glanced back at Ed, catching his calm profile as he entered the house the screen door closing with a soft click behind him. This time, she saw him not just as an old friend transformed but as a challenge, a vision of what lay ahead if she dared to follow. Georgia released her grip on the railing and brushed her palms against her tailored slacks, trying to wipe away both the splinters and the sudden doubt.

[SCENE: CH04_S02 | POV: Ed | Location: Jeta's Grove]

Later that evening, as the moonlight wavered over the pond, Ed sat alone, cross-legged on the soft earth near the meditation hall, the faint hum of cicadas weaving through the stillness. His hands rested loosely on his knees, palms open, his breath shallow and quiet. He didn’t need to close his eyes; to him the world was already luminous.

The gravel path leading to Jeta’s Grove glimmered faintly in his mind. He felt its every stone, the air shifting softly over its curves. Somewhere in the distance, a deer paused mid-step, its heartbeat a soft rhythm that blended with his own. The protocol hadn’t erased his senses; it had made them boundless. Everything touched him, not as noise or distraction but as melody.

The fish are just an excuse. He remembered the words from an elder meditator during his first day at the retreat center. The man had smiled when he asked why so many seemed simply to sit by the water. They’re not looking for answers, only reflections.

Now he understood. The protocol had been a mirror, not a revelation. It had shown him the layers of himself he once mistook for walls. Thoughts came and went like ripples on the pond’s surface, barely noticed, until they vanished entirely. What remained was something simpler, something vast: the endless stillness beneath the surface.

His first hours after awakening had been marked by an almost overwhelming clarity, each sensation sharp and profound. Yet, as the days passed, he found himself drawn to silence, not for what it lacked but for what it contained. He spent long hours listening to the way the wind carried voices and to the pause between the questions people didn’t know they were asking.

Ed’s gaze drifted to his reflection in the water, the faint curve of her face visible among the stars scattered across its surface. His image shimmered as the wind shifted. There was no need to steady it. The distortion was no less real than the stillness.

For years, he had chased moments like this, believing enlightenment would feel like a victory, an achievement. Like finishing that marathon in his forties where he’d collapsed at the finish line, gasping but triumphant—the same way he’d pushed through corporate mergers and retirement planning. But there was no finish line here, no medal to hang on the wall. The protocol hadn’t transformed him into something new; it had simply removed the fog he’d been lost in his entire life.. Stepping through had been inevitable, like finally seeing that the door to the room he’d been frantically searching for had been open the whole time. He smiled from the quiet contentment of knowing he had been here all along, wondering how many others would soon discover their own open doors, and what that might mean for a world built on the very fog he’d left behind.

The moon rose higher, its light bending over the pond and the woods beyond. Ed stood slowly, brushing the dust from his hands. He began walking toward the hall, his movements soft but certain. Each step felt both deliberate and incidental, part of a rhythm he neither created nor resisted.

Behind him, the pond stilled again, reflecting the sky with perfect clarity.

=== CHAPTER 05 ===

[SCENE: CH05_S01 | POV: Zach | Location: Zach's Office]

He held out for months, but Zach Goodman had finally allowed Bud Turner to secure an appointment on his calendar. Zach hadn’t paid much attention to the noise outside his door until Mark, his reliable gatekeeper, called out, “Mr. Goodman will see you now.” Zach’s gaze flicked to the clock on the wall, marking the time with a resigned nod.

Bud slipped through the door with a practiced smile. Zach’s eyes followed his movements, assessing him as he took a seat. “Mr. Turner,” Zach said, his tone neutral as he pushed aside a draft report, “I hope traffic wasn’t too bad this morning.”

Bud’s response was automatic, and Zach noted the slight uptick in his voice, the kind people use when trying to set a casual tone. “Not at all, I actually came in early to run some errands before heading over, so I missed it today.”

Zach glanced at his sparse, impersonal office before focusing back on Bud. “Nice, always good to avoid rush hour,” he replied, adjusting his posture. “So, there’s a conference coming up, and you couldn’t find anyone at your own shop to talk about artificial intelligence in virtual reality?”

The corners of Bud’s mouth twitched upward. Zach couldn’t help but notice how Bud’s eyes darted around the room, taking in the bare walls and the uncluttered desk. “We don’t want to have all the fun,” Bud replied. His voice was smooth, calculated. “It’s an industry-wide affair, and as I said in my email, I think you are particularly well-suited for this topic.”

Zach’s eyebrow arched slightly, a practiced move. He wasn’t new to flattery, and he met Bud’s eyes with an expression that hinted at skepticism. “Yes, you did say that, but I’ve been scratching my head as to why. I’m just a mid-level manager overseeing the creation of a zebra-themed fitness app.” As far as anyone in his professional life was concerned, that was true.

Bud’s grin widened. Zach noticed how Bud’s hands moved, almost theatrically. “I’m sure it will be a smashing success,” Bud said, his voice laced with good-natured sarcasm. He leaned forward. “But that’s not what you’ll be talking about. You’ll be discussing the effects of over-regulation on innovation.”

The statement hung in the air, Zach’s eyes narrowing slightly as he took it in. His desk’s neatness weighed on him. Bud’s voice cut through Zach’s momentary distraction. “You worked on a medical application that didn’t get off the ground, right?”

Zach’s attention snapped back to the conversation and leaned forward. “Someone’s done their homework,” he said, the tone light but guarded. He adjusted his glasses with
