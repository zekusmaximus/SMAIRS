## Phase 1 Milestone (v0.1.0-phase1)

Status: ✅ COMPLETE — Successfully delivered core manuscript analysis foundation.

### Delivered Scope
- ✅ Scene segmentation & anchoring tiers (1–4) with unresolved propagation.
- ✅ Hook scoring heuristic with calibrated exemplars.
- ✅ Character extraction (dialogue attribution + proper noun heuristic) & analytics (frequency + co-occurrence).
- ✅ Reveal extraction & graph (prerequisite mapping with dependency chains).
- ✅ Caching & delta reporting between runs with persistent storage.
- ✅ Labeled segmentation fixture + deterministic & performance tests.
- ✅ Comprehensive report generation: Executive Summary, Changes Since Last Run, Scene Length Histogram, Top 10 Hooks, Character Frequency, Co-occurrence Matrix, Reveal Graph.

### Baseline Performance Metrics (Local Dev Machine)
Synthetic inventories (fixed timestamp, Node 22):

| Label | Words | Scenes | Time (ms) | Heap Δ (MB) |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| small | 8,240 | 0*     | 45.9      | 3.36        |
| large120k | 122,640 | 0* | 430.7 | 5.16 |

*Scenes = 0 because generated synthetic text lacks explicit scene headers in this benchmark variant (intentionally measuring import+analysis overhead). Future perf runs may insert headers to exercise full pipeline including segmentation.

### Phase 1 Achievements
1. **Scene-Level Analysis**: Successfully shifted from chapter-based to scene-based analysis as core architectural principle.
2. **Reveal Graph Infrastructure**: Built comprehensive reveal dependency tracking that enables spoiler detection.
3. **Performance Foundation**: Established sub-2-second processing for 120k-word manuscripts.
4. **Anchoring System**: Implemented multi-tier anchoring (quoted spans + hashes) that survives edits.
5. **CLI Tools**: Delivered working manuscript analysis tools that generate actionable reports.

### Transition to Phase 2
Phase 1 successfully delivered the analytical foundation. Phase 2 builds the Opening Lab decision support system on this foundation, focusing on candidate comparison, spoiler heatmaps, and edit burden calculation.

### Regression Guardrails Maintained
- ✅ Keep <3s target for 120k-word manuscript end-to-end (current ~0.43s on dev machine for non-segmented generation variant).
- ✅ Maintain <200MB heap growth for large baseline.
- ✅ Preserve deterministic outputs with fixed timestamp env.
