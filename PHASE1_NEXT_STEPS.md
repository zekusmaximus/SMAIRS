## Phase 1 Milestone (v0.1.0-phase1)

Status: âœ… COMPLETE â€” Successfully delivered core manuscript analysis foundation.

### Delivered Scope
- âœ… Scene segmentation & anchoring tiers (1â€“4) with unresolved propagation.
- âœ… Hook scoring heuristic with calibrated exemplars.
- âœ… Character extraction (dialogue attribution + proper noun heuristic) & analytics (frequency + co-occurrence).
- âœ… Reveal extraction & graph (prerequisite mapping with dependency chains).
- âœ… Caching & delta reporting between runs with persistent storage.
- âœ… Labeled segmentation fixture + deterministic & performance tests.
- âœ… Comprehensive report generation: Executive Summary, Changes Since Last Run, Scene Length Histogram, Top 10 Hooks, Character Frequency, Co-occurrence Matrix, Reveal Graph.

### Baseline Performance Metrics (Local Dev Machine)
Synthetic inventories (fixed timestamp, Node 22):

| Label | Words | Scenes | Time (ms) | Heap Î” (MB) |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| small | 8,240 | 0*     | 45.9      | 3.36        |
| large120k | 122,640 | 0* | 430.7 | 5.16 |

*Scenes = 0 because generated synthetic text lacks explicit scene headers in this benchmark variant (intentionally measuring import+analysis overhead). Future perf runs may insert headers to exercise full pipeline including segmentation.

### Phase 1 Achievements
1. **Scene-Level Analysis**: Successfully shifted from chapter-based to scene-based analysis as core architectural principle.
2. **Reveal Graph Infrastructure**: Built comprehensive reveal dependency tracking that enables spoiler detection.
3. **Performance Foundation**: Established sub-2-second processing for 120k-word manuscripts.
4. **Anchoring System**: Implemented multi-tier anchoring (quoted spans + hashes) that survives edits.
5. **CLI Tools**: Delivered working manuscript analysis tools that generate actionable reports.

## Phase 2 Milestone (Opening Lab Decision Support)

Status: âœ… COMPLETE â€” Successfully delivered Opening Lab decision support system.

### Delivered Scope
- âœ… Opening candidate generation and scoring with LLM integration (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google providers).
- âœ… Candidate comparison and ranking system.
- âœ… Spoiler heatmap visualization for reveal dependencies.
- âœ… Edit burden calculation for manuscript modifications.
- âœ… UI components: CandidateGrid, CompareDrawer, HeatStrip, and analysis panels.
- âœ… Bridge generation and refinement for manuscript continuity.
- âœ… Performance monitoring and cost optimization for LLM usage.
- âœ… Integration with Tauri backend for desktop application.

### Phase 2 Achievements
1. **Opening Lab System**: Implemented comprehensive decision support for selecting optimal story openings.
2. **LLM Integration**: Added AI-powered analysis and generation capabilities.
3. **Spoiler Detection**: Enhanced reveal graph with heatmap visualizations.
4. **User Interface**: Developed rich UI components for interactive manuscript analysis.
5. **Backend Integration**: Connected frontend with Rust/Tauri backend for robust performance.

## Phase 3 Milestone (Export and Enhancement)

Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS â€” Building export pipeline and advanced features.

### Current Focus
- âœ… Synopsis generation and export formatting.
- âœ… Pandoc integration for multiple output formats.
- âœ… Submission bundle creation with preflight checks.
- âœ… Patch application for manuscript revisions.
- ðŸ”„ Advanced LLM features: Bridge refinement, revision orchestration.
- ðŸ”„ UI polish and additional panels (ExportPanel, VersionCompareModal).
- ðŸ”„ Performance benchmarking and optimization.

### Next Steps
1. **Complete Export Pipeline**: Finalize synopsis generation and ensure compatibility with various publishing formats.
2. **Enhance LLM Capabilities**: Implement advanced bridge generation and revision support.
3. **UI/UX Improvements**: Add more interactive components and improve user experience.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Expand test coverage for new features and ensure stability.
5. **Documentation**: Update user guides and API documentation for new functionalities.

### Regression Guardrails Maintained
- âœ… Keep <3s target for 120k-word manuscript end-to-end (current ~0.43s on dev machine for non-segmented generation variant).
- âœ… Maintain <200MB heap growth for large baseline.
- âœ… Preserve deterministic outputs with fixed timestamp env.
