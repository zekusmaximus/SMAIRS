## Phase 1 Milestone (v0.1.0-phase1)

Status: COMPLETE — tagged as `v0.1.0-phase1` (pending git tag push).

### Delivered Scope
- Scene segmentation & anchoring tiers (1–4) with unresolved propagation.
- Hook scoring heuristic.
- Character extraction (dialogue attribution + proper noun heuristic) & analytics (frequency + co-occurrence).
- Reveal extraction & graph (prerequisite mapping).
- Caching & delta reporting between runs.
- Labeled segmentation fixture + deterministic & performance tests.
- Report sections: Executive Summary, Changes Since Last Run, Scene Length Histogram, Top 10 Hooks, Character Frequency, Co-occurrence Matrix, Reveal Graph.

### Baseline Performance Metrics (Local Dev Machine)
Synthetic inventories (fixed timestamp, Node 22):

| Label | Words | Scenes | Time (ms) | Heap Δ (MB) |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| small | 8,240 | 0*     | 45.9      | 3.36        |
| large120k | 122,640 | 0* | 430.7 | 5.16 |

*Scenes = 0 because generated synthetic text lacks explicit scene headers in this benchmark variant (intentionally measuring import+analysis overhead). Future perf runs may insert headers to exercise full pipeline including segmentation.

### Next Step Candidates (Phase 2)
1. Improve character NER precision (disambiguation, pronoun coref light pass).
2. Expand reveal patterns (tense variations, causal links, "X knows Y" statements).
3. Add scene-level thematic clustering & pacing analysis.
4. Integrate configurable performance threshold gating in CI (warn vs fail).
5. Introduce caching warm path benchmarks (cold vs warm diff).
6. Optional: Persist character & reveal graphs for incremental diffing.

### Regression Guardrails
- Keep <3s target for 120k-word manuscript end-to-end (current ~0.43s on dev machine for non-segmented generation variant).
- Maintain <200MB heap growth for large baseline.
- Preserve deterministic outputs with fixed timestamp env.
