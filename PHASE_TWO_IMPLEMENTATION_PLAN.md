# Phase Two Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase Two transforms the manuscript analysis foundation from Phase One into an intelligent **Opening Lab** that evaluates **3–5** candidate openings through automated scoring, spoiler detection, and edit‑burden calculation. This phase directly supports the project’s singular goal: **selecting the optimal opening scene(s) for agent submission with ≥80% confidence while keeping edit burden ≤10%**.

Building on Phase One’s scene segmentation, anchoring system, and character extraction, Phase Two introduces the **reveal graph** infrastructure, **spoiler‑violation detection**, and **comparative analysis** capabilities that enable authors to make informed decisions about manuscript openings with minimal revision overhead.

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Phase Two implementation is completed. The Opening Lab is fully operational with all core features implemented, including reveal graph, spoiler detection, edit burden calculation, and LLM integration. UI components are integrated, and export functionality is available.

## Objectives
1. **Build Reveal Graph Infrastructure** — Implement comprehensive reveal extraction and dependency tracking to map what readers know at each point in the manuscript.
2. **Create Opening Candidate Selection** — Develop a system to identify and compose 3–5 viable opening scenarios (single scenes, composites, or sequences).
3. **Implement Spoiler Detection Engine** — Calculate violations when scenes are reordered, identifying premature reveals and missing prerequisites.
4. **Design Context Gap Analysis** — Identify missing information readers need when starting at alternate openings.
5. **Calculate Edit Burden Metrics** — Quantify revision effort (word count, span changes, percentage) for each candidate.
6. **Generate Comparative Reports** — Produce side‑by‑side analysis with scores, heatmaps, and recommendations in Markdown/PDF.
7. **Integrate LLM Scoring** — Wire capability profiles (**STRUCTURE_LONGCTX**, **FAST_ITERATE**, **JUDGE_SCORER**) for hook strength and market appeal assessment.

## Technical Approach

### 1) Reveal Graph Construction
**File:** `src/features/manuscript/reveal-graph.ts` *(enhance existing)*
- Extend `extractReveals()` patterns beyond current “_X is Y_” format.
- Add temporal reveals, location changes, and relationship dynamics.
- Build dependency chains using scene ordering.
- Calculate transitive closure for full prerequisite sets.
- Store in an efficient graph structure with **O(1)** lookups for common queries.

---

### 2) Opening Candidate Generation
**File:** `src/features/manuscript/opening-candidates.ts` *(new)*
- Scan first 10 scenes for high hook scores (**> 0.6**).
- Identify natural entry points (new POV, time jump, location shift).
- Compose multi‑scene sequences (2–3 consecutive scenes).
- Create flashback composites (scene + micro‑flashback + continuation).
- Filter by minimum word count (**> 500**) and dialogue presence.

---

### 3) Spoiler Detection Implementation
**File:** `src/features/manuscript/spoiler-detector.ts` *(new)*

```typescript
export interface SpoilerViolation {
  revealId: string;
  mentionedIn: TextAnchor;   // Use Phase One anchoring
  shouldAppearIn: string;
  severity: 'critical' | 'moderate' | 'minor';
  fix: AnchoredEdit;
}
```

- For each candidate opening, traverse subsequent scenes.
- Check reveals against the prerequisite graph.
- Flag violations with anchored text spans.
- Calculate severity based on plot criticality.
- Generate fix suggestions (word replacements, deletions).

---

### 4) Context Gap Analysis
**File:** `src/features/manuscript/context-analyzer.ts` *(new)*
- Extract entity references (characters, locations, objects).
- Compare against established context from original opening.
- Identify undefined references when starting at candidate.
- Generate bridge‑paragraph suggestions for missing context.
- Calculate insertion points using Phase One anchoring.

---

### 5) Edit Burden Calculator
**File:** `src/features/manuscript/edit-burden.ts` *(new)*
- Count new words needed for context bridges.
- Count modified spans for spoiler fixes.
- Calculate percentage of opening text affected.
- Factor in priority levels (critical vs. optional).
- Generate consolidated patch data structures.

---

### 6) LLM Integration Layer
**File:** `src/features/llm/opening-scorer.ts` *(new)*
- Implement capability‑profile abstraction.
  - **STRUCTURE_LONGCTX**: Full‑manuscript structural analysis.
  - **FAST_ITERATE**: Hook scoring per candidate.
  - **JUDGE_SCORER**: Comparative market‑appeal ranking.
- Add **mock mode** using fixtures for offline development.
- Implement **prompt caching** for cost optimization.

---

### 7) Report Generation Enhancement
**File:** `src/features/manuscript/opening-report.ts` *(new)*
- Extend existing `reports.ts` with an `OpeningAnalysis` interface.
- Generate **comparison matrix** (candidates × metrics).
- Create ASCII/Unicode **spoiler heatmap** visualizations.
- Include **tension curves** (before/after edits).
- Export to **Markdown** with embedded recommendations.
- Add **PDF** generation via a Pandoc pipeline (fallback to Markdown if unavailable).

## Dependencies & Risks

### Internal Dependencies
- **Phase One completion** ✅ — Anchoring system, scene segmentation, and character extraction must be stable.
- **Test manuscript** — Provide an 80–120k‑word manuscript at `data/manuscript.txt` for realistic testing.
- **Performance baseline** — Maintain current **< 2s** processing despite added complexity.

### External Dependencies
- **LLM API keys** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for scoring features.
- **Pandoc installation** — Required for PDF export (fallback to Markdown if unavailable).

### Major Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Reveal extraction accuracy **< 70%** | Poor spoiler detection | Implement pattern library; add manual review UI |
| LLM costs exceed budget | Feature disabled | Aggressive caching; **mock mode** default |
| Edit burden consistently **> 10%** | Unusable recommendations | Tune context insertion; allow manual overrides |
| Performance degrades **> 3s** | Poor UX | Profile bottlenecks; incremental processing |
| Complex reveal dependencies | Graph cycles, incorrect prereqs | Add cycle detection; limit dependency depth to **3** |

## Technical Debt Considerations
- Current reveal extraction uses basic regex patterns — consider NLP enhancement in **Phase 3**.
- Character extraction may miss nicknames/aliases — add **coreference resolution** later.
- No UI for manual candidate selection — **CLI‑only** for Phase Two; GUI in a future iteration.

## Validation Strategy
- Create a test suite with **known spoiler violations** for regression testing.
- Generate **synthetic manuscripts** with controlled reveal patterns.
- **A/B test** LLM scores against human beta readers (post‑Phase Two).
- Benchmark against **professional editor feedback** on opening selection.

## Phase Two Exit Criteria
- ✅ Opening Lab generates **3–5 scored candidates** from any manuscript.
- ✅ Spoiler violations detected with **> 90% accuracy** on test cases.
- ✅ Edit burden calculated and verified **≤ 10%** for a majority of candidates.
- ✅ Comparative report generated in **< 3 seconds** for **120k** words.
- ✅ LLM scoring integration functional (**or mock mode active**).
- ✅ All Phase One tests still passing (**no regressions**).
- ✅ Documentation updated with Opening Lab usage instructions.

> Upon completion, the system will provide authors with data‑driven opening recommendations backed by quantifiable metrics, enabling confident submission decisions within the target two‑week timeline.
